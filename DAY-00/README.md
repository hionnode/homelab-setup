# Day 0: The Foundation is Set - Platform Engineering Challenge Begins

*Building the Cloud from Scratch - One Layer at a Time*

## The Curiosity That Started It All

Have you ever clicked "Deploy" on a cloud platform and wondered what actually happens behind that button? Ever been frustrated by the abstractions that hide the beautiful complexity of distributed systems?

Few months ago, I decided to find out. Not by reading documentation or watching tutorials, but by building the entire stack from scratch.

Today, I'm announcing the **30-Day Platform Engineering Challenge** - a journey to demystify cloud computing by rebuilding its core functionality from bare metal to production.

## The Mission Statement

**Build a complete platform engineering stack that replicates enterprise cloud functionality:**
- Container orchestration (like EKS/GKE)
- Auto-scaling and load balancing
- Service discovery and mesh networking
- Distributed databases with failover
- Observability and chaos engineering
- Infrastructure as Code automation

**The twist?** No cloud providers, no managed services, no abstractions. Just pure engineering from the ground up.

## Day 0: Hardware Foundation Complete

### The Arsenal
- **3x Dell OptiPlex 7040 Mini PCs**
  - Intel i3-6100 (2 cores, 4 threads each)
  - 16GB DDR4 RAM per node
  - 256GB SSD per node
- **Network Infrastructure**
  - Managed Gigabit switch for low-latency communication
  - Planned: pfSense for advanced networking
- **Storage Strategy**
  - ZFS replication for data durability
  - Distributed storage across all nodes

### What I Accomplished Today

#### Physical Infrastructure ✅
- Assembled and configured three mini PCs
- Designed network topology for optimal performance
- Cable management and environmental setup
- Power efficiency: 180W total consumption

#### Proxmox Virtualization Platform ✅
- Fresh Proxmox 8.2 installation on all nodes
- Formed a 3-node cluster with automatic failover
- Configured shared storage and networking
- Established remote management capabilities

#### Cluster Validation ✅
- Quorum established and tested
- Network performance benchmarked
- Storage replication verified
- All systems showing healthy status

### The Network Architecture

└─────────────┘ └─────────────┘ └─────────────┘
```

### Key Technical Decisions

#### Why Start with Proxmox?
- **Type-1 hypervisor** for maximum hardware utilization
- **Built-in clustering** eliminates single points of failure
- **ZFS integration** provides enterprise-grade storage
- **Open source** aligns with our "no black boxes" philosophy
- **Production-ready** from day one

#### Why These Hardware Specs?
- **16GB RAM per node** allows meaningful workloads
- **SSD storage** ensures responsive user experiences
- **Gigabit networking** prevents communication bottlenecks
- **Low power consumption** for 24/7 operation
- **Expandable architecture** for future growth

### The Cloud Services We'll Replicate

#### Week 1: Infrastructure Foundation
- **AWS VPC equivalent** → pfSense with VLANs
- **Terraform/CloudFormation** → Infrastructure as Code
- **Route 53** → DNS management and service discovery
- **CloudWatch basics** → Monitoring foundation

#### Week 2: Distributed Systems
- **RDS/Aurora** → PostgreSQL with automated failover
- **SQS/SNS** → RabbitMQ clustering
- **API Gateway** → Custom API routing and authentication
- **Lambda functions** → Microservices architecture

#### Week 3: Container Orchestration
- **EKS/GKE** → K3s cluster management
- **Fargate** → Dynamic container provisioning
- **ALB/NLB** → Ingress controllers and load balancing
- **Service Mesh** → Inter-service communication

#### Week 4: Production SRE
- **CloudWatch/DataDog** → Prometheus and Grafana
- **AWS Config** → Configuration management
- **Chaos engineering** → Fault injection and recovery
- **Disaster recovery** → Backup and restore procedures

### Early Engineering Insights

#### The Complexity Behind "Simple" Cloud Services
- **Auto-scaling** requires sophisticated monitoring and decision algorithms
- **Load balancing** involves complex health checking and routing logic
- **Service discovery** needs distributed consensus mechanisms
- **Zero-downtime deployments** require careful orchestration
- **Observability** demands correlation across multiple data sources

#### Performance Baseline
Current cluster capabilities:
- **Total compute:** 6 cores, 12 threads
- **Total memory:** 48GB DDR4
- **Storage:** 768GB with ZFS compression
- **Network:** 3Gbps aggregate throughput
- **Power:** 180W total consumption

### The Learning Philosophy

#### No Abstractions, Maximum Understanding
Every component will be built to understand:
- **How it works** - the actual implementation
- **Why it works** - the engineering decisions
- **When it fails** - the failure modes and recovery
- **How to optimize** - performance tuning and scaling

#### Engineering Principles
1. **Fail fast and document** - learn from every mistake
2. **Build for production** - no shortcuts or demos
3. **Measure everything** - data-driven optimization
4. **Share knowledge** - complete transparency
5. **Have fun** - engineering curiosity at its finest

### What's Next?

Tomorrow begins the real platform engineering work:

**Day 1:** Network segmentation and security foundations
**Day 2:** VM templates and automation
**Day 3:** Storage replication and disaster recovery
**Day 4:** Firewall and advanced networking
**Day 5:** Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
**Day 6:** Monitoring and alerting foundation
**Day 7:** Week 1 retrospective and lessons learned

### The Ultimate Goal

By Day 30, demonstrate:
- **Complete cloud functionality** replicated locally
- **99.9% uptime** with automated failover
- **Sub-5-second provisioning** for new workloads
- **50+ concurrent applications** supported
- **Enterprise-grade security** throughout the stack
- **Full observability** with metrics, logs, and traces

### Join the Engineering Journey

This challenge is about more than building infrastructure - it's about understanding the beautiful complexity that powers our modern digital world. Every abstraction has engineering decisions behind it. Every "simple" service has sophisticated implementation details.

Follow along as we:
- **Demystify cloud computing** by building it from scratch
- **Learn through failure** and document every lesson
- **Share all code and configurations** openly
- **Create educational content** for the community
- **Have fun** with pure engineering curiosity

### The Foundation is Ready

Three mini PCs humming quietly in the corner. A Proxmox cluster ready for anything. Network cables carrying the promise of distributed systems to come.

The hardware is just the beginning. The real platform engineering starts tomorrow.

**Day 1 begins the journey from bare metal to cloud. Let's build something incredible! 🚀**
